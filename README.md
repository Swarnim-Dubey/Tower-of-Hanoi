# Tower-of-Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves three rods (or pegs) and a number of disks of different sizes. The disks are initially stacked in ascending order on one rod, with the smallest disk on top.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from the starting rod to the destination rod, following these three rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.

Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one stack and placing it on top of another stack or an empty rod.

No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

The challenge is to complete the task in the minimum number of moves, which is 
2^n - 1, where n is the number of disks.

The Tower of Hanoi is often used to illustrate concepts of recursion, problem-solving, and algorithmic thinking in computer science.
